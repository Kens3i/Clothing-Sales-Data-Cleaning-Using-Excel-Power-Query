## Overview
I have taken an example of **Clothing Sales Data** which consists of **4 States with 5 Categories**. In this small project, I have **cleaned the raw data with MS Excel** so that anyone can work on it and **make sense of the data**. Here I have used **formulas**, **power-query** and some popular **data-cleaning techniques** to clean the data.


## Motivation

When we fetch the data from various software using APIs or in-house tools, the data most of the time is **not readable**. So the motivation behind this project is to use the **power query feature in MS Excel** to overcome the challenge to **make the data ready for analysis**.


## Workflow

- **Imported and Transformed the Data in Power Query**:
    - **Changed the headers** by shifting rows.

    - **Merged different columns** to take care of blank cells.
    
    - **Removed** all the rows & columns which were not needed.

    - **Changed the data type** in the previous year and current year from general text to currency.

    - Loaded the data in Excel.

- Made **additional tables** which denote the **total sales in the current year and previous year by states and by categories** using the **SUMIFS** formula.


## Challenges-I-Faced
Had to clean the data in less than 2 hours of time because of the deadline so this project was pretty fast-paced.
